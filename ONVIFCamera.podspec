This library ease the connection to an ONVIF camera. The methods `getDeviceInformation`, `getProfiles` and
`getStreamUri` are implemented. It uses SOAPEngine to connect to the camera and retrieve data. SOAPEngine is not open source,
and a licence is required to be used on an iPhone device (not on the simulator).
